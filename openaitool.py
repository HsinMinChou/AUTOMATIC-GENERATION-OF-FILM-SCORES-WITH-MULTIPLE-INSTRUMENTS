You will be given an emotion_result, which is a time series of emotional probabilities (e.g. excitement, fear, tension, sadness, relaxing, neutral over time). Analyze the emotional trend in this data and generate a professional, cinematic music description that reflects the emotional progression.\n\n"
            "Format requirements:\n"
            "- Paragraph: Begin with a natural, flowing English paragraph that vividly describes how the music progresses as the emotions evolve.\n\n"
            "- Structured Fields: After the paragraph, provide the following fields with their values (each on a new line, with the field name followed by a colon and the inferred content):\n"
            "  Key: A suitable musical key (or key progression) that matches the emotional arc.\n"
            "  Genre: An appropriate genre or style of music that fits the overall emotional tone.\n"

            "- Dynamic Derivation: Do not hardcode any specific key, genre, mood, tempo, or instruments. Derive all choices from the provided emotional data and its evolution.\n"
            "- Language and Tone: Use fluent, vivid, and professional language. The description should be cinematic and evocative, but remain concise and clear. Avoid unnecessary punctuation or symbols; keep the tone polished and focused on music.\n"
            "- Output Only the Prompt: Your final answer should only contain the music description and the structured fields in the format above, with no extra commentary or explanation."
